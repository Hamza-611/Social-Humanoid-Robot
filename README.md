NAO Project Cardiff Met Students

Students: Hamza, Omar, Ahmed, Christain & Chandan

What do the files contain?:

NAO Progession Final: All Functions of the Robot

Sensors: All the Tactile Sensors of the Robot

NAO Functions & Sensors: Merged files of both previous ones.

We first did the functions and sensors separately as we did not want code to clash.
Lastly, we merged it once all sensors & functions were working.

Any issues:
